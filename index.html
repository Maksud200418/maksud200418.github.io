        <h1>Facts About Gorillas</h1>
        <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and share around 98% of their DNA with humans. They live in the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa and are known for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and gentle nature.</p>
        <p>Gorillas primarily eat a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits, leaves, and stems, though some may consume small insects. They live in groups led by a dominant male called a silverback, who protects the group and makes key decisions.</p>
        <p>These primates are highly intelligent and have been observed using tools in the wild. Some gorillas in captivity have even been taught sign language to communicate with humans. Their populations are threatened by habitat destruction, poaching, and disease, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.</p>
        <p>Gorillas display a wide range of emotions, such as joy, sadness, and even laughter. They are known to form strong bonds within their groups, and their social structures resemble those of humans in many ways.</p>
